# 2022 Formula 1 Season (mini and simple) Database
Basic PostgreSQL database I made for a personal project.


### Description
Hiy'all!
This is a basic model for a database for the 2022 F1 Season I made for a personal project. It is made in PostgreSQL via console (with dBeaver). It works as intended, sorta. It may need some updates as I was relearning to do this, as in the bootcamp I took we made simple queries and some inserts but nothing as creating a database from the scratch with a full relational system and such.

This repository contains the backup file and the "master script" as I like to call it, from where the db is created and populated.

This is the basic diagram. I may need to edit it later, but it is what it is, at this moment.

### Some queries

Query that shows the most repeated result for every driver counting the sprints and the GPs but not counting the retirements.

Most retirements in a season (not counting the sprints): Carlos Sainz, 6 retirements. (Only retirements are counted not DNS)

Counting the sprints, Zhou and Carlos are tied with 6 retirements each.

### Future updates

TBA.
